# Working Pipes for Super Tux 
![pipe decal](https://github.com/Eauix/Super-Tux-Additions/blob/main/Working-Pipes/images/decal/_custom/billboard-pipe.png)

This folder contains all the files needed for the enterable pipes to work in your game.

If you want to use the pipes in a level, you must `import("scripts/pipes_util.nut")` into your sector init script, then use the many functions you will find inside the .nut file such as `exit_pipe(string scripted_object)`

The .nut file has comment sections explaining what each function does and when to use them, open it in a text editor so you can understand it better.
