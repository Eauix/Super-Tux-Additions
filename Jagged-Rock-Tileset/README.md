# Jagged Rock Tileset v1.0

* Only the base tiles, corners and autotiles are done for now.
* Slopes, more variants and backgrounds are coming in a future update.
* The "noi" file will not import the default game tiles when used, so it can be imported alongside other custom tilesets. For example, here you'll find a file that will import both the jagged rocks tileset and the snow covering tileset.
