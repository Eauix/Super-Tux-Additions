# Health Bar for Super Tux
![bar](https://github.com/Eauix/Super-Tux-Additions/blob/main/Health-Bar/images/custom_hud/hb_example.png)

This folder contains all the files needed for the health bar to work in your game.

If you want to use the bar in a level, you must import the "health_util.nut" into your sector init script, then use the many functions you will find inside the .nut file such as "use_health(bool use)"

The .nut file has comment sections explaining what each function does and when to use them.
