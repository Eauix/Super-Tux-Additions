# Warning:
Due to tile deprecations in the nightly builds changing lots of their IDs, the snow covering tileset is currently pretty much broken. I mean, not the snow tiles, but all the tiles other than my custom tiles will be broken when you access them whilst using the snow covering tileset I will fix it and optimize its proprieties soon. Use them at your own risk.

# Super-Tux-Additions
Here you'll find everything I created or added as custom assets for Super Tux, like tilesets, scripts, levels or addons.

## Installation Guide for windows:
* Download this repository as a .zip file
* Open the folder with the resources you want to install, for example, the "Snow-Covering-Tileset" folder
* Open the Super Tux Appdata folder (usually at "%Appdata%/Roaming/SuperTux/supertux2"
* Drag all the sub-folders inside the resource folder into the supertux2 folder
* Done!
