# Super-Tux-Additions
Here you'll find everything I created or added as custom assets for Super Tux, like levels, tilesets, scripts addons, etc.

## Installation Guide for windows:
* Download this repository as a .zip file
* Open the folder with the resources you want to install, for example, the "Snow-Covering-Tileset" folder
* Open the Super Tux Appdata folder (usually at "%Appdata%/Roaming/SuperTux/supertux2"
* Drag all the sub-folders inside the resource folder into the supertux2 folder
* Done!
