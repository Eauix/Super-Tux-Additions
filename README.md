# Super-Tux-Additions
Here you'll find everything I created or added as custom assets for Super Tux, like tilesets, scripts, levels or addons.

## Installation Guide for windows:
* Download this repository as a .zip file

* Open the folder with the custom stuff you want to install, for example, the "Snow-Covering-Tileset" folder

* Open the Super Tux Appdata folder (usually at "%Appdata%/Roaming/SuperTux/supertux2")

* Select all sub-folders you find inside the custom stuff folder you want to install (for example, select the "images", "scripts" and "sounds" folder you'll find inside the "Working-Pipes" folder, and drag all of them directly into the "supertux2" folder

* Done!
