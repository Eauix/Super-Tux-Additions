# Eauix's Test Collection
### Due to the file size, I couldn't upload the entire add-on to Github directly, so I'm sharing it via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10miLl2_qXgYL2B2CXlSitDN6MzRfaOWx/view?usp=sharing).

This is going to be my first and only add-on. Due to an imminent change in my life, I won't have nearly as much free time as I used to have until now. 
So, as far as I can tell, I won't be able to start nor to finish any of my planned add-on projects. I'm sorry for this, and I hope you like what I could publish in time.

Note: All the music present in this add-on are not my property. The respective authors are listed in the Credits.

Also, the graphics used in the worldmap tileset are borrowed from Industrial Island 2.

## Note:
This add-on contains outdated Industrial Island 2 assets, which could cause conflicts with the current version's files. I recommend disabling or uninstalling Eauix's Test Collection if you want to play Industrial Island 2 without glitches.
